In fact, MARLEY was not only his business partner but also his executor, administrator, assign, residuary legatee, friend, and mourner upon his passing. This close association is evident in the fact that SCROOGE was deeply affected by MARLEY's death.\n\nHowever, MARLEY did not pass away without leaving a lasting impression on SCROOGE. In a haunting experience, MARLEY appeared to SCROOGE in a ghostly form, which had a profound impact on him. This encounter is a testament to the enduring bond between the two business associates and highlights the significant influence MARLEY had on SCROOGE's life.\n\nThe appearance of MARLEY's ghost was not just a fleeting moment; it seemed to be a deliberate attempt by MARLEY to communicate with SCROOGE, perhaps to convey some important message or warning. This interaction suggests that MARLEY's presence continued to affect SCROOGE even after his physical passing, underscoring the depth of their professional and personal connection.\n\nIn summary, SCROOGE and MARLEY were closely tied through business and friendship, with MARLEY serving as a significant partner in SCROOGE's life.
